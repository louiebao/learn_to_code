# Intro

Coding is hard and especially hard for beginners because once started down this path one can no longer simply rely on human intuition for solving everyday problems and instead will be required to dumb down and think like a machine. The goal of this project is to explain coding in a way that is easy for beginners to understand, and with no assumption of prior coding knowledge.

So what is different about this site compared to the hundreds of tutorial sites out there? I find most if not all of the tutorials focus on only a single programming language and from experience I know this can cause confusion at times when an author tries to explain general programming concepts and yet the target audience was busy memorising language specific syntax. That's why I am covering 3 different languages in my coding examples: 

- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [T-SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transact-SQL)

I am hoping that by seeing an example demonstrated in 3 languages it would help a beginner to focus on the concept rather than syntax alone.
